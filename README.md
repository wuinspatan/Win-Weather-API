🌦️ Win-Weather-API
Win-Weather-API is an open-source weather app that allows you to view real-time weather information for any location in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Get Your API Key
To use this app, you'll need a free API key from OpenWeatherMap:

Go to OpenWeatherMap API Keys.

Log in or create an account.

Copy your personal API key.

2. Set Up the API Key
Open the index.js file and replace the placeholder on line 9 with your actual API key:
